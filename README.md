School: Hult International Business School 
Course: Machine Learning (DAT-5303) 
Assignment: Machine Learning Classification Modeling Case Study (Supervised)

This assignment was to be completed in Python wherein the task was to first conduct an exploratory analysis of the given dataset, and then explore Supervised Machine Learning Classification Modeling algorithms such as but not limited to KNN Classifier, Logistic Regression, Classification Decision Trees (Full vs. Pruned), Gradient Boosting Models (with and without hyperparameter tuning) and Random Forests to determine the model with the highest AUC score.

Business problem: 
Apprentice Chef, Inc. launched Halfway There, a cross-selling promotion where subscribers receive a half bottle of wine from a local California vineyard every Wednesday. The executives want to know which customers will subscribe to this service.
